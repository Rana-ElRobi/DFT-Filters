# DFT-Filters
This repo script Design and implement a program that allows the user to: 
 Browse for a grey scale image file to open and show the image (Img) 
 Text file that contains a 2D kernel (h). 

Each line represents one row of the kernel and the values in each row are separated by some delimiter. 
The values in this file can be edited in any text editor. 
The kernel size should be recognized automatically when opening the file. 
 “Apply Filter” to convolve Img with h using: 
 matlab function, show result. 
 your for loops (not matlab functions), show result. 
 DFT properties (move to FT domain, do your processing, and return back. 
The return should be the convolution result), show result.
